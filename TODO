Things to do:

+ CSS tweaks: hsva for wait time colors, alpha value for unimportant text

+ Make title photos and gallery work more like android material design:
  - title text at bottom, scrim at bottom
  - collapse fades to solid color

+ Implement the difference between a show and a showing

+ Implement dialog to choose the date
  - color days according to crowd estimates

+ Define a bunch more parks

+ Implement park hours by calendar

+ Implement ride closures, show "CLOSED" for time of a closed ride

+ Implement annual pass blocked dates

+ Implement overlay data and reload button
  - key by uid so that ride name could change
  - uid is unique within a park, so there can be two "Space Mountain" rides

+ Park menu accordian?
