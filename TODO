+ Implement title photos and gallery

+ Implement the difference between a show and a showing

+ Implement crowd estimates per minute

  - color days according to crowd estimates

+ Define a bunch more parks

+ Implement hours by calendar

+ Implement ride closures, show "CLOSED" for time of a closed ride

+ Implement annual pass blocked dates

+ Implement overlay data and reload button
  - key by uid so that ride name could change
  - uid is unique within a park, so there can be two "Space Mountain" rides
